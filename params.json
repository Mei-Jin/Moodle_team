{"body":"### Welcome to Moodle magpie team home page.\r\nWe are a group of students taking a Master in Computer Science at University College Dublin, in Ireland.\r\n\r\nAs part of the course, we are doing a development project and have chosen to explore and build some MyMoodle enhancements with a view to primarily focusing on aggregation blocks but looking for feedback and ideas for any other blocks.\r\n\r\nWe have placed the initial ideas from our project sponsor in the following Google Document http://tinyurl.com/d4l5ntn. Once we have done some more research and got more feedback the goal is to prioritise them and then build the ones we can within the duration of the project.\r\n\r\n### Look for Feedback\r\nA quick summary of the ideas (which are site-wide blocks just for MyMoodle) are:\r\n\r\n1. Student My Assignments Block\r\n2. My Timeline Block\r\n3. Recent Communication Block\r\n4. MY Grades Block\r\n5. Site Activity Block\r\n6. Teacher Tasks Block\r\n7. Common Admin Tasks block\r\n(for descriptions see the document)\r\n\r\nWe would love to get any feedback on the existing ideas, what you think of them and if you have any suggestions regarding them or any other blocks you would really like to see developed.\r\n\r\nOnline Survey Enter:  http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/7N3FJBN\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2012, Mei Jin (@Mei-Jin), Jiajia Chen (@ jonaschen623), Karen Holland and Simran.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
